# Big_Ideas_Final

This project was completed for the final project of CMPINF 0010 by Christopher Haas and Nate McDowell. For this proejct, we chose to use data collected from the WPRDC to predict what neighborhood could support the largest population of deer. The factors that we chose for our analysis are tree data, park data, population data, and road data. 

This project was completed using Python written in Jupytr Notebooks. The libraries implemented include PANDAS, GeoPANDAS, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.
