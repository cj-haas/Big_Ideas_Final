# Big_Ideas_Final

This project was completed for the final project of CMPINF 0010 by the Buck team (canvas group 47) with members Christopher Haas (cjh135@pitt.edu) and Nate McDowell(nam154@pitt.edu). For this proejct, we chose to use data collected from the WPRDC to predict what neighborhood in pittsburgh could support the happiest population of deer. The factors that we chose for our analysis are tree data, park data, population data, and road data. 

This project was completed using Python written in Jupytr Notebooks. The libraries implemented include PANDAS, GeoPANDAS, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. We both worked indivudally on our own metrics, but when it came time to combine our data we engaged in pair-programming where we both were on the same computer writing code and giving each other input collaborationg as a group.
